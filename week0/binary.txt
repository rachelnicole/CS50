1  2  3

think of it as 1 in the 100s place, 2 is in the 10s place, and 1 is in the ones place.

100x1 + 10x2 + 1x3

how we think ^ powers of 10.

binary only has 2 values, 0 and 1. 

4  2  1
0  0  0

So, 0 0 1 = 1
    0 1 0 = 2
    0 1 1 = 3
    1 0 0 = 4
    1 0 1 = 5
    1 1 0 = 6 
    1 1 1 = 7
